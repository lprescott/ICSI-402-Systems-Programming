/*Desc: the role of the list command is that prints to the standard output, the information
about the files that are contained in a directory. List is a separate program, so it can be called
manually, by executing its own executable file or from simpleshell.

the program supports the following usage with the following arguments depending on the supplied arguments

(1): list pathname
 when the pathname is a an absolute or relative pathname to a directory. this command
 will print all of the non hidden file names that are contained in a specified directory,
 with one file per a line. Any file names that don't start with a dot are considered to
 be hidden files.

(2): list -i pathname
The -i flag is an indication that any extra information needs to be printed.
The informationthat is printed from this command include the name of the file with
one file per a line. The size of the file stated in bytes, the permission associated
it printed in octal format, and the inode number that is stated as a decimal integer.

(3): list -h pathname
the -h flag is an indication that only hidden files names in a specified directory 
should be printed.

(4): list, list -i, list -h
 any of these commands function the same as the command above, but they are executed
 in the current working directory instead a path that is specified.

/*
Output: the output depends on the arguments being supplied by the user when using the list
command.

/*
  This function finds file size by seeking all the way to the end on the file, then telling the long
  position the position of the end character. This position is the size of the file in bytes. It only takes,
  one argument, which is the FILE type needed to point to.
  
  Trouble with makefile, put here until we can resolve it.
