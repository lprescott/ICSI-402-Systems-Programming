# ICSI-402-Systems-Programming

#### Programming Assignments: 
There will be five (5) programming assignments. These assignments
must be done using the machines provided by the Information Technology Services (ITS)
unit of the University. You can log on to these machines remotely. The programming assignments
must be done using the programming language C. Additional information about programming
assignments is provided at this end of this document.

#### Additional Information Regarding Programming Assignments
##### Documentation: The documentation for each program must include the following:
1. Header information (consisting of all team members’ names, email addresses, and roles) at the
beginning of the program. Each team member should assume the role of a leader, recorder,
and monitor in a round robin fashion.
2. An overall description of what the program does along with descriptions of inputs to the
program and the outputs produced by the program. Any assumptions that you make with
respect to the inputs must be clearly stated.
3. The purpose of every constant, data type and variable declared in your program must be stated
at the point of declaration.
4. For each function you must provide the following:
    * A description of what the function does.
    * Descriptions of all the parameters.
5. In addition to the above, you must also include in-line comments (i.e., comments interspersed
with code) to convey the logic behind your code.

In order for the Instructor to provide any help with your program, you must follow the aforementioned
documentation guidelines.

##### Submission information: 
For each program, you must electronically submit the required file(s)
by the deadline. You should not e-mail your source files to the Instructor.)
At the beginning of each of your source files, you must include (a) your name and (b) your email
address in the form of comments. Failure to do so will result in a 5% __penalty__.

##### Late Submission Policy: The due date and the weightage for each of the five programming
assignments will be indicated on the assignment sheet. __There is no late submission period.__ The
due time of 11:59 PM is EST time and is based on our clock. Even if you submit a few minutes
after the deadline, your submission will be considered late. It is your job to be on time and not
cut it too close. Remember Murphy’s Law and leave time for things to “go wrong.”

##### Correctness of Programming Assignments and Grading: For each programming assignment,
∼ 85% of the grade will be for correctness and the remaining 15% will be for structure and
documentation. If your program has compilation or linking errors, the grade assigned will be zero.
To grade your program for correctness, a script will automatically generate an executable version of
your program and run the executable on new input data sets prepared by the Instructor and/or the
grader(s). Even when your program works correctly on all the sample data sets which were made
available to you, it may fail on the new data sets. It is your responsibility to test your program
thoroughly (e.g., by preparing additional input data sets) before the program is submitted. It is not
possible for the Instructor to identify or fix the bugs in the submitted version of your program.

### Assignment 1:
### Assignment 2:
#### TODO:
- [x] Verify does not have complete functionality (specifically, # of bytes missing)
- [x] Comments must be added to the new functions in other.c
- [x] Many dynamic memory allocations must be free()d.
- [x] By convention, the number of bytes for the length of the name is 4 bytes, it should be 1
- [x] Constants as specified in constants.h should be used
- [x] the supplied archive name may not include a .bin extension!

### Assignment 3:
#### TODO:
- [x] Delete "invid.txt" or related output text file (This is rob saying this, it messes up the program)
- [x] Complete case for same file name in subdirectory
- [x] Complete comments
- [x] Testing
- [x] Refactoring

### Assignment 4:
#### TODO:
- [x] ask professor whether output for hash table needs to be in sorted order
- [x] making sure every file is properly commented
- [x] Refactoring
- [x] testing with addditional examples of SIC/XE code
- [x] delete function for BST and Hash Table (freeing memory at the end)


### Assignment 5:
#### TODO:
- [] attempt extra credit portion
- [] additional comments
- [] refactoring
- [] additonal testing
